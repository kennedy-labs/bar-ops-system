What I understand

Purpose

Your system is a Bar Operations Reconciliation & Profit System. Its job is to turn what physically happens in the business into reliable records, calculations, accountability, and information for the Owner.

It is not a POS, ERP, accounting system, bookkeeping platform, or customer-management system.

Actors

Owner

Manages the system.
Sees management/financial/operational information.
Performs management actions.
Can operate remotely from Workers.

Worker

Performs daily business operations.
Records what actually happens.
Views information relevant to their work.
Does not manage the system.
Core operational reality

The central cycle I understand is:

Opening Shift
↓
View Opening Stock
↓
Physically Count Counter
↓
Verify OR Report Inconsistency
↓
Transition → Active Shift
↓
Operate Business
↓
Record What Happens
↓
Transition → Closing
↓
Count Closing Stock
↓
Record Closing State
↓
Reconcile
↓
Close Shift
↓
Automatic Calculations
↓
Owner Receives Business Information
During an active shift

The Worker may encounter:

Cash payments
Mpesa payments
Expenses
Stock additions
Stock reductions
Stock transfers
Other operational changes represented by the system

The critical principle is:

The Worker records reality. The system calculates and maintains the resulting state.

Stock accountability

The system understands:

Products
↓
Units
↓
Costs
↓
Stock Locations
↓
Inventory Items
↓
Stock Movements
↓
Shift Stock

Stock isn't merely a number. Changes need to become traceable records.

Transfers represent stock physically moving between locations, with a sender/receiver lifecycle.

Money / Mpesa

You've designed Mpesa around real Kenyan operational channels including:

Mpesa Playbill
Pochi la Biashara
Send Money
Buy Goods and Services

The system has:

Mpesa Accounts
↓
Mpesa Transactions
↓
Shift Payment Summary
↓
Reconciliation
↓
Discrepancies

The system should ultimately reconcile what should have happened against what actually happened.

Financial result

After a shift:

Opening reality

- Stock operations
- Payments
- Expenses
- Closing reality
  ↓
  Reconciliation
  ↓
  Profit / Loss

The Worker shouldn't manually calculate this.

Discrepancies

A discrepancy is essentially:

Expected reality
↓
Actual reality
↓
Difference

The system records it and surfaces it to the Owner.

Owner's purpose

The Owner should be able to understand the business without constantly physically meeting Workers.

So information flows:

Worker records reality
↓
System maintains records
↓
System calculates
↓
System detects differences
↓
Owner sees business state
Backend you've already built

You told me the backend is fully developed, including:

Analysis
Auth
Branches
Business
Discrepancies
Expenses
Filters
Inventory Items
Mpesa Accounts
Mpesa Transactions
Prisma
Product Cost History
Product Units
Products
Reports
Shift Stock Items
Shifts
Stock Locations
Stock Movements
Transfers
Users

And you've already implemented endpoints and error handling, with the backend ready to connect to the frontend.

Your implementation philosophy

This is probably the most important thing I understand about your project.

You don't fundamentally want to "build software."

You want to:

Build reality, and have AI translate that reality into software.

Therefore:

YOUR LANGUAGE
↓
REAL BUSINESS BEHAVIOR
↓
IMPLEMENTATION ALGORITHM
↓
TECHNICAL DESIGN
↓
AI TRANSLATION
↓
CODE

AI is not allowed to silently redesign the business.

Your documentation becomes the authority.

Two documentation layers

IMPLEMENTATION_ALGORITHM.md

The journey:

Build opening shift
→ Verify opening stock
→ Transition into active shift
→ Record operations
→ Transition into closing
→ Close shift

It is chronological, realistic, and changes as implementation progresses.

DESIGN_ARCHITECTURE.md files

The destination.

They dictate:

What must exist
How it behaves
Technical structure
File structure
Endpoints
Requirements
Constraints
Performance
Tools
Alternatives
Rules
Testing
Exact implementation algorithm for that component

They should be static and authoritative.

Your biggest implementation constraint

You identified something very important:

Transitions must never be skipped.

Not:

Build A
Build B
Build C

but:

Build A
↓
Verify A
↓
Connect A → B
↓
Verify transition
↓
Build B
↓
Connect B → C
↓
Verify transition

That is how the software stays aligned with reality.

Physical reality constraints
Workers use mobile devices.
Offline operation is preferred as much as realistically possible.
Online interaction should occur where offline becomes impossible.
You want reliable free/minimum-cost resources where possible.
Reliability must not be sacrificed for cheapness.
Technical choices are my responsibility to translate and recommend.
And the ultimate success condition

The system works when the business can operate without requiring the Owner and Worker to constantly meet physically.

The Worker essentially says:

“This is what happened.”

The system says:

“Here is the resulting state, calculation, discrepancy, and record.”

And the Owner can see:

“Here is what is happening in my business.”

That's the system I understand from everything we've built together.
